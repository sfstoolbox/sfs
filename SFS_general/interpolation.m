function B = interpolation(A,X,x)
%INTPOLATION interpolates the given data A(X) at the point x
%
%   Usage: B = interpolation(A,X,x)
%
%   Input parameters:
%       A       - matrix containing data as rows in the form [N M], where
%                     M ... number of points X (2 or 3)
%                     N ... samples of data A
%       X       - matrix containing positions b as columns, at which A(X) is
%                 given [D M]
%                     M ... number of points X (2 or 3)
%                     D ... dimension of space (1 or 2)
%       x       - desired point at which A should be interpolated [D 1]
%
%   Output parameters:
%       B       - interpolated data at point x [N 1]
%
%   INTERPOLATION(A,X,x) interpolates the data A given at two or three points X
%   at the desired position x.
%   Note that the given parameter are not checked if they have all the correct
%   dimensions in order to save computational time, because this function could
%   be called quiet often.
