function win = tapering_window(x0,conf)
%TAPWIN generate a tapering window for a loudspeaker array
%
%   Usage: win = tapering_window(x0,conf)
%
%   Input parameters:
%       x0          - secondary sources / m
%       conf        - configuration struct (see SFS_config)
%
%   Output parameters:
%       win     - tapering window (nlsx1)
%
%   TAPERING_WINDOW(xo,conf) generates a tapering window for a secondary source
%   distribution given by x0. The window is created from a squared Hann window.
%   If the secondary source distribution has some gaps, every joint part gets
%   its own tapering.
%   The mean distance of the secondary sources is calculated within this
%   function in order to identify edges of the array.
