function [x0_indeces,weights] = findconvexcone(x0,xs)
%FINDCONVEXCONE finds three points from x0 with xs in their conic span
%
%   Usage: [x0_indeces,weights] = findconvexcone(x0,xs);
%
%   Input parameters:
%       x0          - point cloud in R^3 / m [nx3]
%       xs          - point in R^3 / m [1x3]
%
%   output parameters:
%       x0_indeces  - row indeces of 3 points in x0 [3x1]
%       weights     - weights [3x1]
%
%   FINDCONVEXCONE(x0,xs) returns three row indeces into x0 and non-negative
%   weights [w1;w2;w3] such that xs lies in the convex cone with minimum solid
%   angle.
%       xs = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + w3*x3 ,
%       where [x1; x2; x3] = x0(x0_indeces,:) .
%
%   (If all x0 and xs have unit norm this is VBAP.)
%
%   This may fail when
%     a) x0 is not convex, or
%     b) The convex hull of x0 does not contain the origin.
