function [dx0,dx0_single] = secondary_source_distance(x0,approx)
%SECONDARY_SOURCE_DISTANCE calculates the average distance between the secondary
%sources
%
%   Usage: dx0 = secondary_source_distance(x0,[approx])
%
%   Input parameters:
%       x0          - secondary sources / m
%       approx      - flag (0/1). If set only the first 100 secondary sources
%                     are used to calculate the distance. This can speed up a
%                     lot the calculation if you are using many secondary
%                     sources. Default: 0.
%
%   Output parameters:
%       dx0         - average distance of secondary sources / m
%       dx0_single  - vector containing the minimum distances of
%                     all secondary sources to the other ones / m
%
%   SECONDARAY_SOURCE_DISTANCE,approx(x0) calculates the average distance dx0
%   between the given secondary sources. First, the distance to its nearest
%   source is calculated for every single secondary source, afterwads the mean
%   about these values is returned.
