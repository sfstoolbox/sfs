Installation Instructions
*************************

Download the Toolbox and add the main path of the Toolbox to your Matlab/Octave
path. After that have a look at SFS_config.m and change it to your
needs. For an easy beginning you can just use the default settings by leaving
everything as it is.
Then start the Toolbox with SFS_start; which will add all needed
subpathes.

If you are using Octave you will need the following additional packages from 
octave-forge (http://octave.sourceforge.net/):
* audio (e.g. for wavwrite)
* signal (e.g. for firls)
