%
%   Input parameters:
%       x0          - position, direction, and weights of the real secondary
%                     sources / m [nx7]
%       xv          - position, direction, and weights of the virtual secondary
%                     sources / m [mx7]
%       dv          - driving signals of virtual secondary sources [Sxm]
%       conf        - configuration struct (see SFS_config)
%
%   Output parameters:
%       d           - driving function signal [Sxn]
