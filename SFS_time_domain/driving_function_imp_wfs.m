%DRIVING_FUNCTION_IMP_WFS_25D calculates the WFS weighting and delaying
%
%   Usage: [d,delay,weight] = driving_function_imp_wfs(x0,xs,src,conf)
%
%   Input parameters:
%       x0      - positions and directions of secondary sources / m [nx6]
%       xs      - position of virtual source or direction of plane wave / m
%                 [1x3]
%       src     - source type of the virtual source
%                     'pw' - plane wave (xs, ys are the direction of the
%                            plane wave in this case)
%                     'ps' - point source
%                     'ls' - line source
%                     'fs' - focused source
%       conf    - configuration struct (see SFS_config)
%
%   Output parameters:
%       d       - driving signals [mxn]
%       delay   - delay of the driving function / s [nx1]
%       weight  - weight (amplitude) of the driving function [nx1]
%
%   DRIVING_FUNCTION_IMP_WFS(x0,xs,src,conf) returns the driving signals and
%   weighting and delay parameters of the WFS driving function for the given
%   source type, position and secondary sources.
