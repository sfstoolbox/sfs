function ir = ssr_generic_nfchoa(xs,src,conf)
%SSR_GENERIC_NFCHOA generate an impulse response for the generic renderer of the
%SoundScape Renderer
%
%   Usage: ir = ssr_generic_nfchoa(xs,src,conf)
%
%   Input parameters:
%       xs      - virtual source position / m
%       src     - source type: 'pw' -plane wave
%                              'ps' - point source
%                              'fs' - focused source
%       conf    - configuration struct (see SFS_config)
%
%   Output parameters:
%       ir      - impulse response for the desired loudspeaker array
%
%   GENERIC_NFCHOA(xs,src,conf) calculates an impulse response for a virtual
%   source at xs for the loudspeakers of a NFC-HOA array. Every loudspeaker of
%   the array is represented by one column in the impulse response.
%   For the generic renderer it is of importance to know what position the first
%   loudspeaker of your array will have. For example, the included circular
%   array has its first loudspeaker at phi=0deg which is on the x-axis. If you
%   have another setup you have to provide it with conf.secondary_sources.x0.
