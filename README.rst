Sound Field Synthesis Toolbox for Matlab
========================================

The SFS Toolbox for Matlab gives you the possibility to play around with sound
field synthesis methods like wave field synthesis (WFS) or near-field
compensated higher order Ambisonics (NFC-HOA).  There are functions to simulate
monochromatic sound fields for different secondary source (loudspeaker) setups,
time snapshots of full band impulses emitted by the secondary source
distributions, or even generate binaural room scanning (BRS) impulse response
sets in order to generate binaural simulations of the synthesized sound fields
with the `SoundScape Renderer`_.
